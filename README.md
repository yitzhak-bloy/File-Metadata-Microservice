# File Metadata Microservice
### A microservice project, part of [Free Code Camp's curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).<br />

User story:

* I can submit a form that includes a file upload.<br />
* The form file input field has the name attribute set to upfile.<br />
* When I submit something, I will receive the file name, type, and size in bytes within the JSON response.<br />


To handle the file upload I use the [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) npm package.

The challenge is here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/file-metadata-microservice
